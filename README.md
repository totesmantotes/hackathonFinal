Soshal Exchange is a Social application in development for both web and mobile deployment. The application is not ready for proper deployment but I want to still explain my project and what Soshal Exchange aims to become. The Soshal Exchange project is a social application that is developed for interacting with friends added to their friends list in a deeper way. The project aims to have a real time chat application that has tabs for "Real Time", "Plans", and "Groups." These tabs are shared with your friends and only YOUR friends. The messages sent are seen by only your added friends. If you and a few others have each other person added, the ones that add each other would see each other's messages. The messages are real time and can be scrolled into, wiping after 48 hours, regardless of photo, text, gif, etc. Users, will be able to connect their MetaMask wallets as well as change which network they want. The crypto exchange portion is meant to allow users to send money to others like venmo, but instead of only interacting with the payment details, there is real time interaction capabilities that will engage the user to chat to people they do not normally, get comfortable with friends that can become better friends/ relationships. 

The target problem is that many people use information to show who they are and not the other way around. My application, allows users to speak their mind, yet not be tied down to social pressure of Social exposure. The catch is, there is no social media from outside. The project focuses on friends and peoples' willingness to interact regardless of whom. Thus, when sending payments using crypto tokens or messaging in real time to your friend's list, people will feel more connected because there is no showing off, just social exchanges between common friends on their friends' list. In addition, people can interact freely without data allocation tracking like other applications.
